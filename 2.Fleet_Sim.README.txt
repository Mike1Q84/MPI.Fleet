# Compile the source code
mpicc -lm -o <output binary file> 2.Fleet_Sim.c
# For example, if output binary file name is Fleet_Sim
# Above command should be
mpicc -lm -o Fleet_Sim 2.Fleet_Sim.c

# Run the binary program
mpirun -np <number of vessels> <output binary file>
# For example, if output binary file name is Fleet_Sim and the number of vessels is 6
# Above command should be
mpirun -np 6 Fleet_Sim

# Attention
# Excessive number of vessels will result “The system limit on number of pipes a process can open was reached”.
# Normally, the number of vessels should be no more than 250.
